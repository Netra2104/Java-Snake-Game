I have a very small laptop so the maximum screen size that I could have chosen that made sense was 750 x 650
If you are decreasing a level, then the fruits that appear are the same fruits that would have appeared
if you had started with that level

If you are on the game over page, then you can only go back to the Splash Page by pressing R

In order to avoid snake to eat itself when the user presses the same key too many times, this case has been handled
So the snake will die only if it eats itself and the user doesn't do anything to prevent it.

As soon as the snake touches the edge of the screen the snake will die...which means that
if you try to turn at the edge of the screen you will still die since you are still touching
the edge

The speed that I have chosen for the snake for all level is the best speed possible
to avoid lagging

The highscore resets when the game resets.

The highscore is calculated by number of apples eaten * current level * 2;

When the game is over, the sound keeps playing over and over again. Did that on purpose to force the user to restart the game and
play it again.

Have Fun!
